# Rectangle

A rectangle inspired Window manager for Windows powered by AutoHotkey.

## Prerequisites

You need to have AutoHotkey v2 installed. 

> Note: I've not tested this with AutoHotkey v1 so things might break.

## Usage

Just download the `rectangle.ahk` script and run it either via command line or by double-clicking the file.
